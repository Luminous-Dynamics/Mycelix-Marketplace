# Cargo configuration for Holochain WASM builds
#
# This file configures the build for wasm32-unknown-unknown target,
# which is required for Holochain zomes.
#
# IMPORTANT: Use "custom" backend, NOT "wasm_js". The wasm_js backend
# pulls in wasm-bindgen which is incompatible with Holochain's WASM runtime.
# HDK 0.6 provides __getrandom_v03_custom.

[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = ['--cfg', 'getrandom_backend="custom"']

[build]
# Set the default target for this workspace
# Uncomment if you want WASM to be the default build target
# target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
